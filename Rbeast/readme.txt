   %       Installation for Matlab or Octave:
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   Method 1: Manually copy all the files in this folder (e.g, beast.m and testdata) to your local folder
             Then, add your local folder to Matlab's search path by running:

             % Replcae c:\beast with your own drive
             >  addpath(genpath('c:\beast')) 

   Method 2: (Recommendded)
	    The easiest way to install is to simply run the following line of command in Matlab's console:
 
             >  eval(webread('http://b.link/rbeast',weboptions('cert','')))  % install to a temp folder
        
             Or install it to a chosen folder by first setting the beastPath variable

             >  beastPath='c:\beast'
             >  eval(webread('http://b.link/rbeast',weboptions('cert',''))) % install to the folder specified by beastPath


   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   %       Uninstall
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   METHOD 1: Simply delete all the downloaded files manually
   METHOD 2: Automatically remove the files by running:
           
             > rbeast_uninstall
